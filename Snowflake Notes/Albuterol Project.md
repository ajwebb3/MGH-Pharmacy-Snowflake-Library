- Plan to minimize environmental impacts of inhaler therapies
- Anthony Ishak has optimized outpatient prescribing of albuterol inhalers to smallest necessary inhaler
- For inpatient formulary, we stock 8.6 g inhaler and there is interest in removing from formulary if there is a lot of waste
- Data requested:
	- How many inhalers are we dispensing that are not used
		- Assessing workload factors
	- Albuterol inhaler dispensed but only used a small number of times
	- Multiple inhalers dispensed to single patient
