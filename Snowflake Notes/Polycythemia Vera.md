| **Briefly describe the question the data will answer** |     | Polycythemia vera (PV) is characterized by erythrocyte hyperproliferation driven by constitutive activation of the JAK-STAT pathway, leading to a state of iron deficiency. Animal models have demonstrated that iron availability influences PV severity and phenotype. Given the increased thrombotic risk associated with hematocrit levels above 45% and evidence that iron repletion may further stimulate erythropoiesis, standard management includes phlebotomy and/or cytoreductive therapy in combination with low-dose aspirin. Patients are generally advised to avoid iron supplementation to prevent exacerbating erythrocytosis. However, when PV is well controlled with cytoreductive agents, the need for ongoing monitoring of iron indices and the permissibility of iron supplementation are less well defined. Current guidelines recommend individualized management, balancing the severity of iron deficiency against the risk of increased erythropoiesis. In their recent update on PV risk stratification and management, Tefferi and Barbui suggest that iron replacement therapy may be reasonable for iron-deficient patients whose hematocrit is well controlled on cytoreductive therapy. We hope to review the safety of IV iron Among well-controlled patients on cytoreduction (medications that lower HCT like ruxolitinib, ropeginterferon, hydrea, pegasys) with fatigue/anemia/iron deficiency, is iron supplementation being used? <br><br>The main question we wish to analyze, in patients receiving IV iron, what is the indication, is there subsequent erythrocytosis, and are there thrombotic events? (check safety of IV iron in PV as typically contraindicated but may have role) <br><br>Secondary outcome: do patients feel better with IV iron (may be more complicated) |

- Regarding ICD10 codes to pull
Thank you so much! I used OE to generate the below. I also cross checked some manually and for heavy menses there are subcodes (like N92.1, N92.2 etc). Let me know if the broad category is enough or if I should include each possibility.

**Heart Failure**

**I50** is the primary code category for heart failure.[1] Specific codes include:

- **I50.1** - Left ventricular failure, unspecified
- **I50.2** - Systolic (congestive) heart failure (with subcodes I50.20-I50.23 for acute, chronic, and acute-on-chronic variants)
- **I50.3** - Diastolic (congestive) heart failure (with subcodes I50.30-I50.33)
- **I50.4** - Combined systolic and diastolic heart failure (with subcodes I50.40-I50.43)
- **I50.81** - Right heart failure (with subcodes I50.810-I50.814)
- **I50.9** - Heart failure, unspecified

**Chronic Kidney Disease**

**N18** - Chronic kidney disease (with stages specified by additional digits: N18.1 through N18.6 for stages 1-5 and end-stage renal disease)

**Gastrointestinal Bleed**

- **K92.2** - Gastrointestinal hemorrhage, unspecified
- **K92.0** - Hematemesis
- **K92.1** - Melena
- Upper GI bleeding: **K25-K28** (peptic ulcer with hemorrhage)
- Lower GI bleeding: **K62.5** (hemorrhage of anus and rectum)

**Heavy Menstrual Bleeding**

**N92.0** - Excessive and frequent menstruation with regular cycle (menorrhagia)

**Vascular Malformation or Anomaly**

- **Q27** - Other congenital malformations of peripheral vascular system
- **I77.0** - Arteriovenous fistula, acquired
- **I78** - Diseases of capillaries (including [hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia](https://www.openevidence.com/rare-disease/hereditary-hemorrhagic-telangiectasia))

**Polycythemia Vera**

**D45** - Polycythemia vera

**Thrombosis**

- **I82** - Other venous embolism and thrombosis (general category)
- **I80** - Phlebitis and thrombophlebitis

**Pulmonary Embolism**

**I26** - Pulmonary embolism (with subcodes for acute and chronic)[2]

**Deep Vein Thrombosis**

**I82.4** - Acute embolism and thrombosis of deep veins of lower extremity[2]

Arterial thrombosis: **I74** (arterial embolism and thrombosis)

I hear you on thrombosis, we will do it manually but would be interesting to compare what can be captured by snowflake vs (Kate, Jess, & team)

**For phlebotomy, we typically searched "phleb" in the chart and looked for the RN note. It is a procedure order as well but it is not always clear when it happens absent the note. For a sample patient, should I give MRN or particular screenshots?**

_Summary:_

_Let me know if MRN or other info for phleb example_

_Totally get it re thrombosis_

_Let me know if above ICD alright or need sub-categories_ 

Thank you so much again!
