| **Briefly describe the question the data will answer** |     | Polycythemia vera (PV) is characterized by erythrocyte hyperproliferation driven by constitutive activation of the JAK-STAT pathway, leading to a state of iron deficiency. Animal models have demonstrated that iron availability influences PV severity and phenotype. Given the increased thrombotic risk associated with hematocrit levels above 45% and evidence that iron repletion may further stimulate erythropoiesis, standard management includes phlebotomy and/or cytoreductive therapy in combination with low-dose aspirin. Patients are generally advised to avoid iron supplementation to prevent exacerbating erythrocytosis. However, when PV is well controlled with cytoreductive agents, the need for ongoing monitoring of iron indices and the permissibility of iron supplementation are less well defined. Current guidelines recommend individualized management, balancing the severity of iron deficiency against the risk of increased erythropoiesis. In their recent update on PV risk stratification and management, Tefferi and Barbui suggest that iron replacement therapy may be reasonable for iron-deficient patients whose hematocrit is well controlled on cytoreductive therapy. We hope to review the safety of IV iron Among well-controlled patients on cytoreduction (medications that lower HCT like ruxolitinib, ropeginterferon, hydrea, pegasys) with fatigue/anemia/iron deficiency, is iron supplementation being used? <br><br>The main question we wish to analyze, in patients receiving IV iron, what is the indication, is there subsequent erythrocytosis, and are there thrombotic events? (check safety of IV iron in PV as typically contraindicated but may have role) <br><br>Secondary outcome: do patients feel better with IV iron (may be more complicated) |
