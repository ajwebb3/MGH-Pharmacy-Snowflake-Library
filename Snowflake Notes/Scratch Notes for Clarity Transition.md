- EDW_SOURCE_ZONE_CLARITY.Common.Clarity_Medication
	- List of medication names with primary key being MEDICATION_ID
	- Seems similar to EDW_SOURCE_ZONE_EPIC.Reference.Medication

	- Has primary key of ORDER_ID, seems similar to EDW_SOURCE_ZONE_EPIC.Orders_Clinical but perhaps not as specific as the subfolders within that?

	- Not specific to meds, has no link to medication ID
