| **Briefly describe the question the data will answer** |     | The outcomes-based portion of this request would allow our committee to track bleeding and thrombotic outcomes related to our practice at MGH. Our intent would be to identify areas that we are below national average in and focus on these areas for practice changes.                                                                                                                                            |
| **Please list the data elements you are requesting**   |     | - Development of DVT or PE in ICU - Time in therapeutic range for our standard sliding scales - DTI - Heparin Time in therapeutic range - Warfarin Bleeding outcomes while on therapy- We would pick a standard definition based on query abilities - Andexanet alfa - 4 factor PCC - Heparin Thrombotic outcomes out to 7 days after administration (Stroke, DVT, PE, MI) - Andexanet alfa - 4 factor PCC - Heparin |
